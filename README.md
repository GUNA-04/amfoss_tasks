# amfoss_tasks

Hello, my name is Guna Maneesh, and I am from CSE-AI (A). I have a foundation in programming, having learned C in my first semester, and I also have proficiency in Python. Beyond academics, I am passionate about fitness—I hit the gym daily—and I enjoy reading novels during my free time.

Why should we choose you?
I am a consistent and dedicated individual who takes every task seriously. If given the opportunity, I will ensure to contribute to the club's success through my skills, commitment, and willingness to learn.

How do you intend to contribute back to the club?
My interest in joining the club stems from my experience with the Hacktoberfest event, which sparked my passion for open-source contributions. I aim to enhance my knowledge in this domain, actively participate in projects, and support my fellow club members by sharing insights, collaborating on initiatives, and fostering a spirit of learning and innovation within the group.
